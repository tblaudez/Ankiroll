<h2 align="center">Anki with a chance of Rickroll</h2>

> Never gonna give you up... but maybe your flashcards will !

An add-on for the spaced-repetition flashcard app [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) that will bring a fun twist to your Anki reviews by randomly displaying a Rickroll before each answer is shown.

### Acknowledgments

The code architecture of **Ankiroll** is heavily inspired by [Ankitty](https://github.com/marvinruder/ankitty) by marvinruder, which itself is a fork of [Puppy Reinforcement](https://github.com/glutanimate/puppy-reinforcement) by glutanimate.

Big thanks to these awesome developers for their work! Without them, Ankiroll wouldnâ€™t have had such a solid foundation to deliver unexpected Rickrolls to unsuspecting learners !

Never gonna give you up... but definitely gonna give you credit! ðŸš€
